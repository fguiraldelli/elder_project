- rank.py - this file is a main type file, that make the calls for other files that executes the logic of the program;
- input_output.py - this file handles the inputs and outputs of the program and instantiate the class enterprise;
- enterprise.py - this file is the class Enterprise, this class stores the values nedeed for counting and calculatingof values to show summary, favorable answers, valid and invalid answers;
- unittest_input_output.py - this file make some unit tests in input_output.py file;
- unittest_enterprise.py - this file run some unit tests in class Enterprise;
